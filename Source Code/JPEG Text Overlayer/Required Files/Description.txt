JPEG Text Overlayer

JPEG Text Overlayer allows you to load an image file and then overlay your specified text on it. You can then save the file to any of the various formats supported by the application (bmp, png or jpg). You can specify the font type, size, effects as well as the positioning of the text. Limited text shadow and opacity functions are also enabled.
